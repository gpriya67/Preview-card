🛠 My Process
1. Planning

Reviewed the design files, identified spacing, colors, typography, and layout.

2. HTML

Built the base structure using semantic elements such as <article>, <img>, and <a>.

3. CSS

Styled the card using Flexbox, custom properties, shadows, and hover/focus states.

4. Responsiveness

Ensured the card scales smoothly on all device sizes.
